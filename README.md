# Customer Banking System

## Overview

This project is aimed at developing a banking system application for customers, focusing on savings and CD accounts. The application enables users to calculate and track interest over time, providing a clear and efficient way to manage and understand their financial growth.

## Key Features

- **Interest Calculation**: Users can calculate the interest earned on their savings and CD accounts.
- **Account Tracking**: The application allows tracking of account balances after interest accrual over a specified number of months.

## Usage

The application is divided into several key components:

- `Accounts.py`: Base class for account management.
- `savings_account.py`: Module to handle savings account operations.
- `cd_account.py`: Module to manage CD account operations.
- `customer_banking.py`: The main driver of the application.

To run the application, execute `customer_banking.py`. This will prompt you to input your savings and CD account details and then display the calculated interest and updated account balances.
